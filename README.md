This C++ code analyzes patterns in an integer array by checking if it is sorted and if it has consecutive elements. The program accepts an integer array as input and stores its size in the variable n. It then checks if the array is sorted using a nested loop and sets the boolean isSorted to true if all elements are in ascending order and breaks out of the loop when a non-consecutive element is found. Finally, it prints the result based on the value of isSorted. If n equals 1, it means that the array contains only one element and the program prints "The array contains only one element". If isSorted is false, it means that the array does not have consecutive elements and the program prints "The array does not contain consecutive elements". Otherwise, it prints "The array contains consecutive elements".
